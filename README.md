**AIM OF GRAY CODE COUNTER:**

Gray Code, also known as Reflected Binary Code, is a binary numeral system where two successive 
values differ in only one bit.

This property is particularly useful in reducing errors in digital 
communications and rotary encoders where minimizing transitions can prevent glitches. 

A Gray Code Counter serves specific purposes in digital systems where minimizing errors and 
ensuring reliable data transitions are critical. 

Understanding its aim involves exploring the unique properties of Gray code and the scenarios where these properties offer significant advantages over traditional binary counting.
